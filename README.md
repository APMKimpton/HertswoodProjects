# HertswoodProjects

Hello!

This is a public REPO of mine. It contains all the work I did while studying Computing A Level at Hertswood Academy. Do whatever you like to these files, they are here more of an example of my work rather than their usefulness!

All the best,
Antony

P.S. These are some of my first programming files, so they maybe sloppy or disfunctional.
